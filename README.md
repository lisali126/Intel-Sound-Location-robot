# Intel-Sound-Location-robot
Spherical robot is an 2017 SJTU IPP project hosted by a team of five, with the assistance of SJTU and Intel. 

Its software part is the combination of two algorithms: robot locomotion and sound localization. Various data transmission tasks in the robot are also involved.

Based on the enhanced TDOA method, the robot can locate the sound source and transmit data to control the its locomotion in this branch.
